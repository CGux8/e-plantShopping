# Ziad's Plants - E-commerce Website

Welcome to **Ziad's Plants**, where green meets serenity! This project is a small e-commerce website built using **React** as part of my learning journey in **Full-Stack Development** with IBM. The website is now live on **GitHub Pages** and showcases a variety of plants that can be purchased online.
